# Traffic Modelling - Real Road Networks

This code provides the background work for a report investigating traffic dynamics using agent-based modelling, focusing on how lane closures and merging lanes impact traffic flow. I build on the Nagel-Schreckenberg (N-S) traffic model, a widely used framework for simulating realistic vehicle behaviour. Starting with a one-lane model, I verify its performance against the N-S model, demonstrating its ability to replicate key traffic behaviours such as the formation of traffic jams and wave propagation. The model is extended to include multi-lane traffic with lane-changing rules and scenarios involving lane closures with and without the addition of a hard shoulder. Then, some analysis is conducted into the effects of lane closures on traffic build-up and clearance times. 

The simulation shows a multi-lane implementation significantly reduces congestion compared to a single-lane model. When lane closures are introduced, traffic congestion is reduced faster by allowing vehicles to merge proactively or opening a hard shoulder. While insights from observed traffic patterns at the M8 Dechmont Interchange are incorporated, especially in setting parameters, the analysis focuses on simulated scenarios to explore the effects of lane closures and hard shoulder usage. Results suggest that proactive merging strategies and hard shoulder use during peak traffic can significantly reduce congestion clearance times.

The code is written in Jupyter Notebook using Python programming.
